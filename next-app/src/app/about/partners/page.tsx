Data is one of the most valuable products of research, and it is therefore crucially important that we ensure that it is managed appropriately throughout its lifecycle. In response, SciLifeLab and The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW) have launched the DDLS program in Sweden. This initiative aims to train and develop the next wave of life scientists, enhancing Sweden's capabilities in data science within the life sciences to achieve international competitiveness. The DDLS program has been funded by KAW for 12 years. SciLifeLab, as a national infrastructure for life science, coordinates this program in close collaboration with ten Swedish universities and the Swedish Museum of Natural History.",
