            "description": "BIG3 is a collaborative initiative focusing on biobanking and molecular research in glioma, a type of brain tumour. The project aims to integrate clinical data with molecular analyses to enhance the understanding of glioma biology and develop more effective treatments. By establishing a comprehensive biobank of glioma samples, BIG3 facilitates research into tumour genetics, microenvironment, and response to therapies. This resource is instrumental in identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to personalised medicine approaches in neuro-oncology. The collaborative nature of BIG3, involving multiple research institutions and healthcare providers, ensures a multidisciplinary approach to tackling the complexities of glioma, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and survival rates.",
